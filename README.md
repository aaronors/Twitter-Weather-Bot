# Twitter-Weather-Bot

A Twitter bot that tweets the current weather for a random 5-digit postal code very 3 hours. Uses the Google Maps API to process the postal code, the Dark Sky API to return the weather forecast, and the Twitter REST API to manage the botâ€™s actions. Deployed with Heroku. Currently adding more features.
